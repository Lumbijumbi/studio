Key principles and practices for modular component organization:
Feature-Based Organization:
Group related components, hooks, utilities, and state management logic within dedicated feature directories (e.g., src/features/Posts, src/features/Authentication).
This promotes encapsulation and keeps feature-specific code isolated, minimizing dependencies between different parts of the application.
Component Granularity:
Design components to be small, focused, and responsible for a single piece of UI or functionality.
Distinguish between "presentational" components (focused solely on UI rendering) and "container" components (managing data and logic).
Shared Components and Utilities:
Create a shared or common directory for highly reusable components (e.g., Button, Input) and utility functions that are not specific to any single feature.
This prevents code duplication and promotes consistency across the application.
State Management Isolation:
Manage feature-specific state within its respective feature directory using libraries like Redux, Context API, or Zustand.
This limits the scope of state changes and simplifies debugging.
Encapsulation of Logic:
Abstract business logic (e.g., API calls, data formatting) into custom hooks or separate service files within the relevant feature directory.
This keeps components focused on rendering and improves testability.
Clear Folder Structure and Naming Conventions:
Establish consistent conventions for naming files and folders (e.g., PascalCase for components, camelCase for files).
A well-defined structure makes it easier for developers to navigate and understand the codebase.
